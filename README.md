This repository is created to help understand SOLID Principles with basic examples.

# SOLID principles are core of OOPs programming and helps in writing scalable and maintainable code.
# There are 5 principles as explained below :

1. Single Responsibilty Principle : There should be a separate for each fucntionality / similar operations.

2. Open - Closed Principle : Any class should be open (can add new methods) to new operations but new operations should 
   not break it's single responsibility principle.
                             
3. Liskov Subsitution Principle : A class can reference its child classes's objects without breaking the actual functionality.

4. Interface Segregation Principle : It's an extension of Single Responsibilty principle. There should be separate interfaces 
   created for every different set of similar operations, don't try to merge all operations in one single interface.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle : The classes should be loosely coupled with each other by means of abstraction.
